# Where to See INVENTORY_MOVEMENTS in the UI

## Current Implementation ⚠️

### What You Currently See:
In the **Admin Dashboard → Inventory Tab**, you can see the `InventoryTracking` component which displays:

✅ **Current stock levels** for all products  
✅ **Stock value** calculations  
✅ **Low stock alerts**  
✅ **Stock status filters** (Low/Normal/Good)  
✅ **Search by product name, category, or barcode**  

### What's Missing:
❌ **Inventory Movement History** (the INVENTORY_MOVEMENTS table)  
❌ **Audit trail** of stock changes  
❌ **Who made stock changes** and when  
❌ **Reason for adjustments**  
❌ **Before/after quantities**  
❌ **Movement types** (sale, purchase, adjustment, damage, etc.)

## What INVENTORY_MOVEMENTS Should Show

The **INVENTORY_MOVEMENTS** table is an **audit trail** that tracks every single stock change with complete details:

### Movement Types:
1. **Initial** - When product is first created
2. **Purchase** - Stock received from supplier
3. **Sale** - Stock sold to customer (automatic)
4. **Adjustment** - Manual stock corrections
5. **Return** - Customer returns
6. **Damage** - Damaged/expired items removed
7. **Transfer** - Stock moved to another location

### Information Tracked:
- **What** changed (product name, barcode)
- **How much** (quantity, before/after amounts)
- **When** (timestamp)
- **Who** did it (user name)
- **Why** (reason/notes)
- **Type** of movement
- **Reference** (linked to sale, purchase order, etc.)

**Filters**: By product, date range, movement type, user  

### Option 2: Sub-section in Current Inventory Tab
Add a section at the bottom of the existing Inventory tab

**Location**: Admin Dashboard → Inventory Tab → New Section  
**Shows**: Recent movements (last 50-100 entries)  

### Option 3: Product Detail View
Show movements when clicking on a specific product

## Recommended UI Layout

### **Admin Dashboard Structure:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Admin Dashboard                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Overview] [POS] [Products] [Inventory] [Movements] [Reports] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

When "Inventory" tab is selected:
- Shows current stock levels (existing InventoryTracking component)

When "Movements" tab is selected: ⭐ NEW
- Shows inventory movement history with filters
- Ability to add manual adjustments
- Export movement history
```
